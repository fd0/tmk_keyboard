/*
 * DEBOUNCE describes how many matrix scan phases a key must stabilize after an
 * edge was detected before a new edge is accepted.
 *
 * On Ergodox matrix scan rate is relatively low, because of slow I2C.
 * Now it's only 317 scans/second, or about 3.15 msec/scan.
 * According to Cherry specs, debouncing time is 5 msec.
 *
 * Older Cherry switches were observed to have a debounce time of 8 to 10ms, so
 * we set this to 4 by default. The current debouncing code will transmit the
 * keypress to the PC instantly on the first edge, so this value does not
 * influence the latency at all.
 *
 * This value must be larger or equal to one.
